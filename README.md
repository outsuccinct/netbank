# 🏦 Bank System - CQRS, Event Sourcing, Event-Driven, Minecraft Integration

This project is a **banking system** implemented using **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**, **Event Sourcing**, and an **Event-Driven architecture**, with full **integration into Minecraft**.  

---

## Features
- Separation of **commands** (write operations) and **queries** (read operations)  
- Immutable **event store** capturing all changes to aggregates  
- Asynchronous **event-driven updates** to read models  
- Scalable design allowing independent scaling of read and write sides  
- Direct **integration with Minecraft**, enabling in-game banking operations and player interactions  

---

## Architecture Overview
- **Commands** trigger actions in aggregates  
- Aggregates generate **events** representing state changes  
- **Event Store** persists events in an immutable log  
- **Read models** are updated asynchronously from events for optimized queries  
- **Event Bus** (Kafka) propagates events between services  
- **Minecraft plugin layer** interacts with the system, translating in-game actions into commands and events

## 💻 Technology Stack
- Java, Spring Boot  
- Postgres for event storage  
- Kafka for event-driven communication  
- Minecraft server integration  
- Optional read model databases for optimized queries
